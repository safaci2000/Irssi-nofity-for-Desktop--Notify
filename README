This script generates desktop notification bubbles for personal messages and highlighted messages.
This script is a adapted version of the well known http://code.google.com/p/irssi-libnotify/ 

UPDATE: Recently there was some upstream effort to move irssi-libnotify to DBus as well. As by now, it is parently still unusable. But if you like to check them out fetch the "dbus-branch" from their repository. It is using perl::Net::DBus to send messages.
